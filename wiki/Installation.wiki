= Some short notes about installation of the toolchain =

== Toolchain for firmware 2.2 (currently only 32Bit Linux) ==

First create a project dir. Now download the iphone_sdk 2.2 from apple. You could also download the 2.2 firmware from apple. If not, the script is downloading the file itself.

{{{
mkdir ~/Projects/iphone/toolchain
cd ~/Projects/iphone/toolchain
svn checkout -r45 http://iphonedevonlinux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk ./
mkdir files
mkdir files/firmware
mv /path/to/iphone_sdk_2.2_file ./files/
mv /path/to/firmware2.2_file ./files/firmware
./toolchain.sh headers
./toolchain.sh darwin_sources
./toolchain.sh firmware
./toolchain.sh build
}}}

After all steps the toolchain is in ./toolchain with the binaries in ./toolchain/pre/bin and the system in ./toolchain/sys/
